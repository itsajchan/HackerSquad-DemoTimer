# Welcome to HackerSquad Demo Timer.

[I](https://linkedin.com/in/itsajchan) designed this app to be a tool used at Hack Nights, pitch nights, and other events.

The app gives you two input boxes. These are two separate timers in seconds. When the first timer goes up, you'll hear an audible DING informing the speaker that the first timer is up, by default, this value is set for 3 minutes. When the second timer is up, the system plays an audience applauding, signaling to the audience that they should also applaud and celebrate the speaker on stage, the default value for the second timer is 1 minute.
